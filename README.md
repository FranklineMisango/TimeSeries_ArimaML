# ARIMA Time Series
![](arima.png)
Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is among one of the more popular and widely used statistical methods for time-series forecasting.
It is a class of statistical algorithms that captures the standard temporal dependencies that is unique to a time series data.
ARIMA is an acronym for “autoregressive integrated moving average.” It’s a model used in statistics and econometrics to measure events that happen over a period of time.
The model is used to understand past data or predict future data in a series. 
It’s used when a metric is recorded in regular intervals, from fractions of a second to daily, weekly or monthly periods. 

- Auto Regressive (AR) regression model is built on top of the autocorrelation concept, where the dependent variable depends on the past values of itself.
- Integrated(I): The integrated part of ARIMA attempts to convert the non-stationarity nature of the time-series data to something a little bit more stationary. By performing prediction on the difference between any two pair of observation rather than directly on the data itself.
- Moving Average(MA) attempts to reduce the noise in ourtime series data by performing some sort of aggregation operation to your past observations in terms of residual error.

## MLOps On GCP

This repository contains the code files involved in creating an automated MLOps Pipeline on GCP (Google Cloud Platform).

### Steps:
* Clone the repository
* Place your model file inside the ```output``` folder

Once you made the changes, create a new repository and commit the changes. From here on, this will be your source repository. Proceed with the below steps
###### Cloud Build Trigger
* In your GCP concole, create a new cloud build trigger.
* Point the trigger to your source repository
###### Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
* From the console lauch a kubernetes cluster
* Connect to the cluster and create the following two files
  * deployment.yaml
  * service.yaml
* Copy the code for both files from "Kubernetes Files" folder in cloned repository
* Execute the following commands
    * ```kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml```
    * ```kubectl apply -f service.yaml```
* Get the name of the deployment with the following command
    * ```kubectl get deployments```
###### Cloud Pub/Sub
* Create a Pub/Sub topic with the name ```cloud-build```
* Provide a subscription for the topic, which is to trigger a cloud function
###### Cloud Functions
* From Pub/Sub console launch the cloud function window
* Provide the following Environment variables through the GUI console
    * ```PROJECT``` (project name)
    * ```ZONE``` (Region in which in the project is deployed ex.uscentral-1)
    * ```CLUSTER``` (Name of the kubernetes cluster created earlier)
    * ```DEPLOYMENT``` (Name of the deployment inside the kubernetes cluster)
* Copy the program code and requirements.txt files for the cloud function from ```cloud-function-trigger``` folder
* Configure the Entrypoint for the cloud function as ```onNewImage``` 
* Deploy the function

After successful deployment, make a commit to source repository and the following will happen in sequence
* Cloud Build will push message to Pub/Sub upon successful build
* Pub/Sub will trigger the cloud function
* Cloud function will deploy the new image on Kubernetes
    * To test the deployment, check the logs on kubernetes cluster using the following command
        * ```kubectl get pods```
        * ```kubectl logs <pod name>```
    * The deployment will reflect in the logs as well as in the endpoints
